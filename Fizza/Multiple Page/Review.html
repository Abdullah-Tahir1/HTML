    <p class="text1">1.Undeniably a great tv show; beautiful cinematography, amazing costume work, and superb acting. Henry Cavill as Geralt is everything! My only complaint is that the storyline is a bit chaotic, the show jumps around and goes off on tangents, and it's hard to keep up.
         However, the main storyline is compelling, the characters are well developed, and I can't wait for more! </p>
