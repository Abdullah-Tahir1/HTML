        The Witcher is a fantasy drama web television series created by Lauren
        Schmidt Hissrich for Netflix. It is based on the book series of the same
        name by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. The Witcher follows the story
        of Geralt of Rivia, a solitary monster hunter, who struggles to find his
        place in a world where people often prove more wicked than monsters and
        beasts. But when destiny hurtles him toward a powerful sorceress, and a
        young princess with a special gift, the three must learn to navigate
        independently the increasingly volatile Continent.The story begins with
        Geralt of Rivia, Crown Princess Ciri of Cintra, and the sorceress
        Yennefer of Vengerberg at different points of time, exploring formative
        events that shape their characters throughout first season, before
        eventually merging into a single timeline. Geralt and Ciri are linked by
        destiny since before she was born when he unknowingly demanded her as a
        reward for his services by invoking "the Law of Surprise". After the two
        finally meet, the witcher becomes the princess's protector and must help
        her and fight against her various pursuers to prevent her Elder Blood
        and powerful magic from being used for malevolent purposes and keep Ciri
        and their world safe.
