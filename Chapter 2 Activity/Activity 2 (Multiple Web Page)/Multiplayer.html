            <summary><em><u>Overview:</u></em> Call of Duty: WWII returns to the gameplay often featured in the older Call of Duty games, featuring the standard grounded movement. It also features similar server support to that of previous games. However, unlike previous iterations, the game now features a special social place, the Headquarters section with the ability for the player to reside in between games. A special new game mode has also been added to the multiplayer which takes players on a simulated battle with objectives designed in an attack/defense style mode, called War. <br><br></summary>
                <details><summary><em><u>Divisions: </u></em> When the player first launches the multiplayer in Call of Duty: WWII, the player will enlist their soldier in one of five Divisions, Infantry, Airborne, Armored, Mountain and Expeditionary respectively. Each of the divisions is attuned to a specific weapon category or loadout preference but can be changed freely throughout the game. Divisions are not locked to certain weapon categories, however and the player can benefit from all but the first perk of each Division if they decide to use a weapon outside of the Division's category. <br><br></summary>
                    <summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the player uses their Division, they will level up their Division and gain extra perks for their Division. The first perk of each Division, however, is restricted to the respective weapon class of that Division. Divisions are able to be prestiged after reaching level 4 with the respective division. The rewards for prestiging a division range from a new weapon (SVT-40, MP-40, MG 42, Kar98k and the Sawed-off Shotgun respectively), to Calling Cards, Uniforms and finally, a Weapon Variant for the respective division weapon.</summary>
