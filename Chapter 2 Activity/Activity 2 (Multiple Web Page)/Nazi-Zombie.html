            <summary><em><u>Overview:</u></em> You’re part of an international crew of experts, thrown together by circumstance in pursuit of a fortune in stolen art. You and your crew have arrived at a seemingly abandoned German village well behind enemy lines. Here, you'll face rampaging monsters, an infinite supply of bloodthirsty zombies, and darker experiments capable of nothing but murder. There is never enough time, nowhere near enough ammunition, and virtually no chance to escape. <br><br></summary>
                 <details> <summary><em><u>Plot: </u></em> German engineer Marie Fischer is sent on a mission to her hometown village of Mittelburg, Bavaria by her commanding officer, Major Rideau, to retrieve lost artifacts stolen by the Nazis for experimentation, as well as rescue her brother, Klaus, who provided the information. Klaus has been unwillingly working with their lead scientist Peter Straub and weapons expert Colonel Heinz Richter on a project to exploit a new energy dubbed "Geistkraft" to assist the Nazi party's war efforts. Marie is accompanied by ex-art thief Drostan Hynd, French Resistance fighter Olivia Durant and military captain Jefferson Potts, all of whom have significant knowledge on the stolen arts. However, on their train ride to Mittelburg, the group is attacked by an unidentified colossal being. Marie is stranded from the others, and finds herself taking temporary refuge at a small house nearby, where she holds out against hordes of dead German soldiers reanimated by Geistkraft, until she is able to make her way to the village. <br><br></summary>
                    <summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After reuniting with the other three, Marie and the group proceed further down into the village, and inside Straub's lab. There, they fend off against Straub's undead horde, as well as Richter, whose obsession on weaponization of Geistkraft puts him at odds with Straub. Eventually, the group recovers the artifact, the hilt of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa's Sword. They then encounter the creature from earlier, a humanoid-shaped amalgam of numerous body parts sewn and stitched together, dubbed the Panzermörder, with Klaus fused into the creature's chest. Using special magnetized batteries, the group manages to stun the Panzermörder and attach the batteries onto it, causing it to be attracted to Richter's zeppelin flying above the village. The zeppelin explodes, killing the Panzermörder and freeing Klaus from its body. The hilt's power somehow revives Klaus, causing him to be possessed by an unknown force. Klaus staggers into the village, telling Marie and the group to continue fighting, and that the Emperor must not return, before activating a fire trap, engulfing himself in flames.</summary>
